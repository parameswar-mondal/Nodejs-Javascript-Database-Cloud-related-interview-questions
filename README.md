### Q: What is Node.js, advantages of Node.js and how does it work?

`Ans:` Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, which means that it can be used to create scalable, high-performance web applications.

Node.js works on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it uses a single thread to handle multiple connections, without blocking the execution of other requests. This makes it possible to build fast and responsive web applications that can handle large numbers of concurrent connections.

Because Node.js is based on JavaScript, front-end developers who are familiar with JavaScript can easily switch from the client-side to the server-side. It also has a large and strong developer community that has produced a wide range of modules and libraries that may be used to increase its functionalities.

The fact that Node.js is highly modular and can be used to create both server-side and client-side applications is one of its main benefits. Additionally, NPM (Node Package Manager), a built-in package manager, makes it simple to install, manage, and share reusable code libraries.



> ## Conceptual Questions

### Q: What is your experience with designing and developing scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available back-end systems?

`Ans:` Designing and developing high-performance systems that can scale horizontally and vertically. For scalability and high performance we can use things such as load balancing, caching, database sharding, and message queuing to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### Q: What is database sharding ?

`Ans:` Database sharding is a technique used to partition large databases horizontally across multiple servers, also known as shards or nodes. In this technique, a database is split into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is stored on a separate server and contains only a portion of the data, and each server operates independently of the others. 
Sharding is typically used to address scalability issues, allowing a database to handle larger volumes of data and higher transaction rates. By distributing the data across multiple servers, the system can handle more queries and transactions in parallel, providing better performance and reducing the likelihood of a single point of failure. 
Sharding can be implemented using various methods, including range-based sharding, hash-based sharding, and composite sharding. In range-based sharding, data is partitioned based on a predefined range of values, such as date ranges or alphabetical ranges. In hash-based sharding, data is partitioned based on a hashing algorithm that evenly distributes data across the shards. Composite sharding combines both range and hash-based sharding methods. 
While sharding provides significant benefits in terms of scalability and performance, it also introduces additional complexity in managing a distributed system. Sharding requires careful consideration of data distribution and replication strategies, as well as fault tolerance and disaster recovery mechanisms. 

### Q: What is caching ?

`Ans:` Caching is the process of storing frequently used data in a high-speed temporary storage location, called a cache, to improve system performance and reduce latency. In computer systems, a cache is a small amount of memory that is used to store frequently accessed data so that it can be accessed quickly without needing to be fetched from the original source.
Caching is used in many different areas of computing, including web browsers, operating systems, databases, and file systems. For example, web browsers use caching to store recently accessed web pages, so that when a user revisits the same page, it can be quickly displayed without needing to be downloaded again from the internet.
Caching can improve system performance by reducing the amount of time it takes to access data. Since accessing data from a cache is much faster than retrieving it from the original source, using a cache can significantly reduce latency and improve the overall responsiveness of a system.
However, caching also introduces the risk of serving stale or outdated data. Therefore, it is important to manage cache expiration and invalidation to ensure that the cached data is always up to date. Additionally, caching can consume a significant amount of system resources, so it is important to carefully manage cache size and eviction policies to ensure that the system remains stable and responsive.

### Q: Can you explain the different types of databases you've worked with and the advantages and disadvantages of each?

`Ans:` I have experience with different types of databases such as SQL and NoSQL databases. It has the benefits and drawbacks of each, such as SQL's ACID compliance and NoSQL's horizontal scaling capabilities.

### Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of SQL and NoSQL databases ?

`Ans:` SQL and NoSQL databases each have their own advantages and disadvantages, which are summarized below:
**Advantages of SQL databases:**
- SQL databases have been around for many years and are widely used, which means there is a large pool of experienced developers and administrators.
- SQL databases use a well-established standard query language (SQL) that is easy to learn and widely supported.
- SQL databases are highly structured, which makes them well-suited for complex data models and relationships.
- SQL databases provide strong consistency and transaction support, which is important for applications that require strict data integrity and reliability.

**Disadvantages of SQL databases:**
- SQL databases can be difficult to scale horizontally, which can limit their performance and scalability for large-scale applications.
- SQL databases require a fixed schema, which can make it difficult to accommodate changes to the data model.
- SQL databases can be expensive to license and maintain, especially for large enterprise deployments.
- SQL databases can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if not properly secured.

**Advantages of NoSQL databases:**
- NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can be easily distributed across multiple servers, making them well-suited for large-scale applications.
- NoSQL databases are schema-less, which makes it easier to accommodate changes to the data model.
- NoSQL databases can handle unstructured or semi-structured data types, such as documents and key-value pairs.
- NoSQL databases are often more flexible and performant than SQL databases for certain use cases, such as high write throughput and real-time data processing.

**Disadvantages of NoSQL databases:**
- NoSQL databases are less established and less widely used than SQL databases, which means there may be a smaller pool of experienced developers and administrators.
- NoSQL databases often lack a standard query language, which can make it more difficult to write complex queries and perform ad-hoc analysis.
- NoSQL databases may sacrifice strong consistency in favor of eventual consistency, which can lead to data inconsistencies if not carefully managed.
- NoSQL databases may require more complex data modeling and indexing, which can increase the complexity of application development.

### Q: What is SQL's ACID compliance?

`Ans:` ***ACID*** is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably and consistently. SQL's ACID compliance ensures that database transactions are processed in a way that guarantees data integrity and reliability.

**Atomicity:** A transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work, which means that either all of the operations in the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. If a transaction fails for any reason, all changes made by that transaction are rolled back, leaving the database in the state it was in before the transaction began.

**Consistency:** A transaction is processed in a way that ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction. This means that any changes made by the transaction must satisfy all constraints and integrity rules defined by the database schema.

**Isolation:** Each transaction is executed in isolation from other transactions, which means that the results of a transaction are not visible to other transactions until the transaction has been completed. This ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other and that the database remains consistent.

**Durability:** Once a transaction is completed successfully, the changes made by that transaction are permanently stored in the database and will survive system failures, power outages, or any other type of disruption.

In summary, SQL's ACID compliance ensures that database transactions are processed reliably and consistently, and that the data remains accurate and valid even in the face of system failures or other disruptions. This makes SQL databases a popular choice for applications that require strong data consistency and integrity, such as financial systems or e-commerce applications.


### Q: How do you ensure that the back-end system is secure and can handle potential security breaches?

`Ans:` Should implement security measures such as SSL encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and penetration testing. Also maintaining the strategies for handling security incidents and staying up-to-date with the latest security threats.

### Q: Describe your experience with cloud-based technologies and services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

`Ans:` I have experience with cloud-based technologies and services such as AWS and Azure. Share your experience of how you've used these services to build scalable and reliable back-end systems.

### Q: What is your approach to debugging complex issues in the back-end system, and how do you prioritize and handle critical bugs?

`Ans:` There are several ways that we can use and do the debugging of the backend issues. Like: 
- We can use console.log and just print statements to the console. While this seems to work fine, it is not usually the best approach to take when debugging a complex Node.js application.
- To properly debug our applications, we’ll need a debugger-an application designed to step through code execution line by line, examine the states of variables. Generally I used a VSCode debugger for this.
- The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.


### Q: How do you ensure that the back-end system meets performance and reliability requirements, and what metrics do you use to measure this?

`Ans:` Metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates to measure performance and reliability. They may also discuss strategies for load testing and capacity planning.

Ensuring that the back-end system meets performance and reliability requirements is crucial for the success of any application. Here are some steps that can help ensure performance and reliability:

- Set performance and reliability requirements: Establish clear and measurable performance and reliability requirements for the back-end system. This will help you define what performance and reliability mean for your application and how they will be measured.
- Conduct load testing: Perform load testing to simulate real-world scenarios and evaluate the system's performance under various conditions, such as high traffic or heavy load. This will help you identify potential bottlenecks and performance issues.
- Monitor system metrics: Monitor key system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network latency, and response time. This will help you identify issues before they become critical and proactively address them.
- Implement caching: Use caching to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in a high-speed temporary storage location. This can help reduce latency and improve system responsiveness.
- Optimize database performance: Optimize database performance by using indexing, partitioning, and other techniques to improve query performance and reduce database load.
- Implement redundancy and failover: Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure system reliability and minimize downtime. This can include using load balancers, redundant servers, and failover clusters.
- Use monitoring and alerting tools: Use monitoring and alerting tools to receive real-time notifications when performance or reliability issues arise. This will help you quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact end-users.

### Q: Can you describe your experience with containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes?
